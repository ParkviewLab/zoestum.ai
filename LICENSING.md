# Licensing

This repository is the **zoestum.ai** website. It is **standard copyright** —
*not* open source. Its first-party files (HTML, CSS, build scripts, written

## Bundled third-party

| Bucket | License |
|---|---|
| Site, scripts, content, brand mark (`assets/img/`) | `LicenseRef-AllRightsReserved` (all rights reserved) |
| Bundled Michroma typeface (`assets/fonts/`) | `OFL-1.1` — third-party, don't relabel it |

## REUSE compliance

This repo is [REUSE](https://reuse.software/)-compliant: every file has a license
via an SPDX header or a [`REUSE.toml`](REUSE.toml) annotation (full texts in
[`LICENSES/`](LICENSES/)). Verify with:

```bash
uvx --from "reuse[charset-normalizer]" reuse lint
```

Any new file needs an SPDX header or a `REUSE.toml` entry, or the lint breaks.
GitHub shows no license badge — that's correct for an all-rights-reserved repo.
