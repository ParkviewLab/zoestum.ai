# ParkviewLab conventions

This repo follows the [ParkviewLab handbook](https://github.com/ParkviewLab/handbook/tree/main): the single source of truth for how we work. These pointer files don't re-inline its rules: read the handbook before non-trivial work, starting with [`ai-collaboration.md`](https://github.com/ParkviewLab/handbook/blob/main/docs/ai-collaboration.md) (the behavioural contract). Only the safety-critical guardrails are summarized here.

**If present, read `docs/northstar.md` before working.** It states the project's intent and is authoritative.

## Shared-state writes need explicit authorization
- **Merging a feature PR into `develop` is the user's call.** A broad directive ("fix all that", "finish it") authorizes work on the branch, not the merge. The back-merge pull request of a release is merged under that release's ask; nothing else is inferred from it.
- **Tagging, cutting a release, force-pushing, or pushing to a protected branch each need an explicit, per-action go-ahead**: never inferred from a descriptive label (e.g. "→ v0.1.1"). One release ask covers the whole CLI release flow, `git back-merge` included: its merge of the back-merge pull request once `develop`'s required checks have passed on the head, and the force push of its own `back-merge-<tag>` branch where it refreshes it.

## Workflow basics
- Work in an ephemeral, prefixed worktree off `develop` (`feature-`/`fix-`/`doc-`/…); don't commit on `develop`/`main` directly. Open a PR into `develop`.
- PRs into `develop` are merged with a merge commit titled with the PR title and number, so the PR title carries the Conventional Commit prefix (`feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/…) the changelog is generated from.

**Everything else lives in the handbook** (don't rely on memory): branching, commits & changelogs, releases, Python tooling, CI, licensing, and the full communication norms; see <https://github.com/ParkviewLab/handbook/tree/main/docs>.

## This repo is a website (live / staging)

zoestum.ai follows the lighter
**[website profile](https://github.com/ParkviewLab/handbook/blob/main/docs/website.md)**,
not the package flow in the block above. What's different here:

- **Branches are `live` (production, served by GitHub Pages) and `staging`
  (integration, the default branch)**, not `main`/`develop`. Every change reaches
  `staging` by a pull request from a prefixed working branch (`feature-`/`doc-`/…),
  a typo's fix included; nothing is pushed to `staging` directly (website.md).
- **Publishing = promote `staging` → `live`** (`git merge --ff-only staging && git push`
  from the live worktree), which triggers the Pages deploy. **No version bumps,
  tags, or releases.**
- Promoting to `live` **publishes to the internet** — that's the shared-state write
  that needs an explicit go-ahead (the release rule above, mapped to this repo).
- **Preview before publishing:** `scripts/preview.sh` stamps the date + serves the
  site locally; review there, then promote.
- The per-page "updated on" date is a **build artifact** (`scripts/stamp.py`),
  stamped at deploy — not committed. Licensing is **standard copyright**; keep
  `reuse lint` green.
