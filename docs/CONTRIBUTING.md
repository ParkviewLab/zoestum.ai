# Contributing

zoestum.ai is a ParkviewLab **website repo** — it follows the
[website profile](https://github.com/ParkviewLab/handbook/blob/main/docs/website.md),
a lighter flow than the org's package repos.

## Edit & publish

- Work on **`staging`** (the default branch). Small edits can go straight to
  `staging`; for a bigger change, use a prefixed worktree branch (`feature-`,
  `doc-`, …) off `staging` and merge it back.
- **Preview locally** before publishing: `scripts/preview.sh` stamps the "updated
  on" date and serves the site at `http://localhost:8000` — exactly what will deploy.
- **Publish by promoting `staging` → `live`** (from the `live` worktree:
  `git merge --ff-only staging && git push`). The push to `live` triggers the
  GitHub Pages deploy. There are **no version bumps, tags, or releases**.
- Promoting to `live` **publishes to the internet** — treat it as the go/no-go
  gate; get an explicit go-ahead first.

## What's generated (don't commit)

The per-page "updated on" date is a build artifact, produced by `scripts/stamp.py`
at deploy (and by the preview). The assembled `_site/` is `.gitignore`d.

## Licensing

Standard copyright (all rights reserved) plus the bundled Michroma font under
`OFL-1.1`. Every file needs an SPDX header or a `REUSE.toml` entry — keep
`reuse lint` green:

```bash
uvx --from "reuse[charset-normalizer]" reuse lint
